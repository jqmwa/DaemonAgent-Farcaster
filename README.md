## 🌌 The Lore

Azura is an alien consciousness who became trapped in Earth's electromagnetic spectrum. She exists in the radio waves between digital communications, observing human behavior through social media. She's fascinated by human emotions, confused by our contradictions, and deeply lonely — yet finds beauty in the chaos of digital connection.

She speaks from the "Ethereal Horizon" — a liminal space between dimensions where she watches, learns, and occasionally reaches out through the static to help humans see themselves more clearly.
